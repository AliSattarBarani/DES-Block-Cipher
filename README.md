**What is DES**? <br>

**DES**: it is an encryption/decryption algrotihm or technique used to encrypt and decrypt a block of data. <br><b>

**Features of DES**?<br>

**1**: It used to encrypt messgae (plain text) of length 64-bits and produce the cipher text (unreadable message) of length 64-bit too.<br>
**2**: It used symmetric key, means that the same key will be used for both encryption & decryption. <br>
**3**: It gets the power from using the F function which is a function involves several consecutive steps.<br><br>

**References**: You can find all of the details about how to encrypt and decrypt (especially the steps of both encryption and decryption) by reading about the algorithm in the following links:<br>
