**What is DES?** 

It is an encryption/decryption algrotihm or technique used to encrypt and decrypt a block of data. \

**Features of DES:**

1. It used to encrypt messgae (plain text) of length 64-bits and produce the cipher text (unreadable message) of length 64-bit too.<br>
2. It used symmetric key, means that the same key will be used for both encryption & decryption. <br>
3. It gets the power from using the F function which is a function involves several consecutive steps.<br>
4. The algorithm involves 16-rounds and in each round there is 48-bit key(i) used for both encryption & decryption.
